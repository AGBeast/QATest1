# Project Description
I have created a couple of variations for test automation. In this project you will notice that I have a file called basic_script.py. As the name suggests, this is just a script in order to verify that the Follow and Share buttons exist on the influencer's page. 

Under the POM directory, I have approached it using a more scalable technique known as Page Object Model where pages are classes and the test cases take make assertions. My current implementation can be perfected as better abstraction is possible.
